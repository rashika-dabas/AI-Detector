# AI-Text-Classifier

## Task
Classifying essays into LLM Generated or Human Generated texts

## Models
1. RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) - LSTM and Transformer Architecture Model
2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) - Type of RNN Model
3. FNN (Feedforward Neural Network) - BERT Model using Transformer Architecture

## Final Optimal Model - LSTM Model

## Conclusion
After conducting tests through the user interface, our team observed that the results often matched our expectations, accurately identifying essays as either LLM-generated or human-authored. However, there were instances of discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes. This led us to conclude that the LSTM model's performance could be further enhanced.
